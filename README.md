# Easy-Whitehole

Repository containing the usual and latest **Whitehole** versions used for **SMG1/2 modding** in a prepared form so you can get them working right away (**Win32/64 only for now**).

All credit goes to the creators/mantainers/developers of these **Whitehole** versions. I just packed them into a nice **7Z** compressed file so you can use the programs without having to set up **Java** (*Epik Java*). Also thanks to the **Adoptium** and **Liberica JDK Download Center** for the binary releases of **JRE 8 and 17** which are used in each compressed package shared.
