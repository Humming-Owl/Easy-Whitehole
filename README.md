# Easy-Whitehole

Repository containing the usual and latest **Whitehole** versions used for **SMG1/2 modding** in a prepared form so you can get them working right away (**Win32/64 only for now**).

**All credit goes to the creators/mantainers/developers of these Whitehole versions**. I just packed them into a nice **7Z compressed file** so you can use the programs without having to set up **Java** (*Epik Java*). Also thanks to the **Adoptium** and **Liberica JDK Download Center** for the binary releases of **JRE 8 and 17** which are used in each compressed package shared.

# Important

**Windows users:** 

Use **7zip** to extract the contents of the **7Z files** shared --> https://7-zip.org/download.html

# Usage

**Windows users:** 

- Inside each **Whitehole folder** there is a `Whitehole-[Version].bat` file, double click on it and it should open right away!
- There is also an `UpdateObjectDatabase.bat` file on some **Whiteholes** (**v1.6** and **v1.7** specifically), double click on it to update the **Object Database**.

# Notes

- For absolute beginners Whitehole Despag is the one recommeded. When you get more familiarized with SMG modding you can test the other editors.
- Whitehole v1.7 can't open Galaxies that have unused zones. You have to manually delete unused zones of a Galaxy. As a quick workaround open the Galaxy you can't open on Whitehole v1.7 in Whitehole Despag and immediately hit Save (`File > Save`), then, you will be able to open said Galaxy on Whitehole v1.7.
- New Object Databases do not work on Whitehole for SMG1.
- Whitehole v1.7 does not render well Galaxies under Integrated Intel Graphics (screen is black while you don't move in the editor).
- Whitehole Despag will update the Object Database automatically each time you run the program (don't worry about updating it manually).
- Whitehole for SMG1 is only used for its Scenario editor that works with SMG1.
